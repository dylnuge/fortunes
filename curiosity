The 27th (and most recent) amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1992,
had the longest ratification process of any amendment. It was passed by Congress
on September 25, 1789, as part of the Bill of Rights. The movement to ratify it
was started by a college sophomore in order to protest a bad grade from a
professor who told them it couldn't be done.

In any mathematical system that includes recursion (which is pretty much all the
useful ones), if the system is consistent, there must be some true statements
about the system which cannot be proved within the system.

There are as many fractions as there are counting numbers (1, 2, 3...), but
there are infinitely more real numbers.

In 1943 a group of doctors in Rome hid nearly two dozen Jewish people fleeing
the Holocaust by inventing a disease they called "Syndrome K." Fearing
infection, Nazi inspectors avoided the quarantined regions of the hospital.

UK electric grid operators prepare to fail over additional power from French
electric plants during primetime TV commercial breaks in order to compensate for
the increased demand in power from many people turning on electric tea kettles
simultaneously.

The shell command "^tyop^typo" will rerun your previous command replacing "tyop"

The pure oxygen explosion which occured during the Apollo 1 plugs-out test was
similar to an incident which killed Cosmonaut Valentin Bondarenko 5 years
earlier during testing of the USSR's Vostok project. Due to the intense secrecy
around the Soviet space program, this incident was not disclosed until 1986.

In flight communications the word "takeoff" is only used at the moment when a
plane is requesting immediate clearence to take off or in the process of taking
off. At all other times, the term used is "departure." This is one of the
safeguards put in place following the Tenerife airport disaster.

The 2003 blackout in northeastern America was partially caused by a race
condition in the software running on an alarm panel. Operators were unaware they
were relying on outdated information and made decisions which lead to a
cascading failure.

"vi" originally stood for Visual Interface, as it was a visual version of ex

Agloe, NY was a real place, but it wasn't real when it was first added to a map
in the 1930s by mapmaker General Drafting. The intent was to catch people
counterfeiting their maps, but a real general store sprung up on the spot in the
1950s.

An eruv wire, which is frequently attached along telephone poles, surrounds an
area with a large Orthodox Jewish population. The wire marks the boundaries of a
community within which carrying objects is permitted on the Sabbath. There are
eruvin in most major US cities including one in Manhattan that encompasses much
of the island, an area stretching from Harlem to the East Village.

Sites (and apps) like Google Maps used to use a variant of the Mercator
projection, called Web Mercator, which dropped terms from the projection that
were expensive to compute. Google Maps now smoothly transitions to a spherical
map at further zoom levels.

The symbol used in music for common time (4/4 time) looks like a "c" but is
actually a broken circle. This represents the perceived imperfection in the 14th
and 15 centuries of 2:1 ratios, where 3/4 time was represented by a full circle,
and common time was called tempus imperfectum.
%
The most common form of "battery" used to store electrical energy for later use
is pumped storage hydroelectric, where water is pumped using electric motors
from a lower resovior to a higher one, and dams are opened when the energy is
needed later. The US electric grid is capable of storing 25 GW of energy this
way.

In the maple syrup black market, the people who move product are not called

The CSS color "rebeccapurple" was added as a memorial to Eric Meyer's daughter.

The period ('.') character is a perfectly legal character to include within a
DNS label name under the normal DNS spec. Since it is usually used as a readable
label separator, it's generally not used as part of names in practice.

The tzinfo timezone database has eight different timezones located in the US
state of Indiana to cover the historical changes to time in various portions of
the state, including which time zone they are in and whether they observe
Daylight Savings Time. Three other tzinfo entries also cover portions of the
state, making for 11 total distinct timezones covering the state.

The Farenheit system for temperature measurements is based around a 0Â°
temperature that is equivalent to the freezing point of a slurry of salt, ice,
and water. This is intended to match a very cold day, but it also means that if
it's below zero Farenheit, salting sidewalks won't work to melt the ice.
%
The Celsisus system of temperature measurements was originally designed
backwards, with hotter temperatures being represented by lower numbers (0Â°C was
the boiling point of water and 100Â°C the freezing point). Several scientists
independently inverted the scale within a few years of its invention, including
Carl Linnaeus.
%
The SI base unit for mass is the kilogram, and it is the only base unit to have
a metric prefix (e.g. kilo-, mega-, centi-). In 2019 it was redefined to be
based on fundamental physical constants, but before that it was equal to the
weight of an actual physical kilogram kept in a vault.

Reading from /dev/urandom is entirely cryptographically secure and preferable to
reading random data from /dev/random (blocking random). On systems which
implement the getrandom(2) syscall, you can also use that!

It's possible to embed a PDF and a Zip archive in the same file (i.e. identical
binary data), where opening it in a PDF viewer will display a normal document
but unzipping it will extract hidden files. This is an example of something
called a polyglot file.

Nuclear power is one of the only major forms of electric production on the
planet that isn't ultimately using energy from Earth's sun. Fossil fuels come
from dead plant and animal matter, wind is produced by the uneven heating of the
Earth by the sun (different temperatures create different pressures, hence
wind), hydroelectric power relies on both wind and evaporation for the water
cycle, and solar power is pretty self-explanatory. Heavy metals like uranium
aren't produced by solar fusion, though; they come from supernovae.
%
Video file formats tend not to just store a bunch of full frames in sequence;
instead they are made up of i-frames, which contain a full image, as well as
p-frames and b-frames, which contain only the difference between a frame and the
surrounding frames and can be used for compression within a scene where much of
the image remains static.

The highest frequency sounds any humans can hear are at 20kHz (and hearing near
the edge of this range drops off rapidly with age). This means recording audio
at 40kHz or higher perfectly captures all the sounds *humans* can hear with no
loss of information.

The Toledo War, fought between Ohio and Michigan in 1835 and 1836, resulted in a

In 1792, during the French Revolution, France attempted to move to a system of
decimal time, dividing the day into 10 decimal hours, each with 100 decimal
minutes of 100 decimal seconds (the seconds themselves were shorter to account
for a decimal day having 100,000 seconds instead of the 86,400 seconds in a
standard day).

ðŸ•´ (Man in Business Suit Levitating, U+1F574) was added as an emoji to Unicode
